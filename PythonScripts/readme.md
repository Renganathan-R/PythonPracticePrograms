## Instructions to run the python programs in the repository
1. Save the python scripts locally on your machine.
2. Make sure you have installed the python on your PC.
3. Open command prompt and locate the folder using the command **cd** **directory address**
4. Enter the name of the script and hit enter.

For windows 10 users:

+ For all the programs, I have used the linear algorithm which do the basic math and gives the required results.
+ Also the below programs have a checking part which indicates user while entering wrong inputs.
  ##### i. factorial. py
  * This program gets the input from user and calculates the factorial only if the correct input is given.
  * The way it calculates the factorial is **For example, an input 6 is given** then it starts multiplying the numbers from 1 till the entered number 6. (1* 2* 3* 4* 5* 6)
  ##### ii. fibonacci. py
  * This program gets the input from user and calculates the nth fibonacci only if the correct input is given.
  * It uses a for loop that generates a list which has the fibonacci sequence till the entered nth fibonacci number.
  * Then its uses the formula Fn-1+Fn-2 to calculate the result.
  ##### iii. gcd. py
  * This program gets the input from user and calculates the gcd of the given numbers only if the correct input is given.
  * It has two functions; One for generating divisors of the given numbers, Second for finding common divisors of the given numbers using lists.
  * Finally it prints the maximum of the common divisors lists which is nothing but the gcd.
