## **Instructions to run the python scripts in the local repository**
**For windows 10 users (command prompt not powershell)**
1. Save the python scripts locally on your machine.
2. Make sure you have installed the python on your PC.
3. Open command prompt by type `cmd` in the search bar.
4. Locate the folder where you saved the scripts using the command. `>cd (directory address)`
5. Enter the name of the script and hit enter. `>C:\Users\User\Documents\PythonPracticePrograms>Factorial.py`
## **Programs information**
+ For all the programs, I have used the linear algorithm which do the basic math and gives the required results.
+ Also the below programs have a checking part which indicates user while entering wrong inputs.
  ##### i. factorial. py
  * This program gets the input from user and calculates the factorial only if the correct input is given.
  * The way it calculates the factorial is **For example, an input 6 is given** then it starts multiplying the numbers from 1 till the entered number 6. (1* 2* 3* 4* 5* 6)
  ##### ii. fibonacci. py
  * This program gets the input from user and calculates the nth fibonacci only if the correct input is given.
  * It uses a for loop that generates a list which has the fibonacci sequence till the entered nth fibonacci number.
  * Then its uses the formula Fn-1+Fn-2 to calculate the result.
  ##### iii. gcd. py
  * This program gets the input from user and calculates the gcd of the given numbers only if the correct input is given.
  * It has two functions; One for generating divisors of the given numbers, Second for finding common divisors of the given numbers using lists.
  * Finally it prints the maximum of the common divisors lists which is nothing but the gcd.
